- ðŸ‘‹ "Hello! I'm Aditya Vishwakarma , a driven project manager, game developer, and creative enthusiast. With experience in managing projects, I've developed strong skills and a passion for innovation.

In the realm of game development, I've honed my skills on Scratch and am currently exploring the world of Godot. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field, with the ultimate goal of founding my own game development company.

As a multifaceted creative, I'm also skilled in video editing (Adobe Premiere Pro) and cinematography. I enjoy bringing stories to life through visual media.

When I'm not coding, editing, or developing, you can find me expressing my creativity through painting, cooking, or lifting weights at the gym. Music is also a huge passion of mine!

I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals, learn from their experiences, and share my own knowledge and skills. Let's grow and learn together!

Feel free to reach out and let's start a conversation!"
